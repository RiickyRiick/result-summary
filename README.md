## Overview

Overall execution was excellent, however, I need more practice in learning how to place my footer .attribution with the design (sometimes my design gets thrown off by the footer)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process
HTML:
--I first began with HTML semantics, i.e., tag names, class names, and correct grouping according to the design

CSS:
--I continued with CSS, i.e., setting up the universal and body selectors with their respective values
--I then proceeded to work from top to bottom :
  -starting from the navigation heading, primary header, grid container, and finishing off with the footer
--Sizing and positioning were my main objectives before moving on to stylizing the fonts
--Lastly, I create a few @media queries to adjust the background-image for all different viewport sizes


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about @keyframes again. The ease of implementing them in your code is great. I plan to continue using @keyframes more and focus on better positioning the footer.
