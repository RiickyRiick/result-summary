## Overview

Overall execution was excellent, however, I need more practice in learning how to place my footer .attribution with the design (sometimes my design gets thrown off by the footer)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process
HTML:
--I first began with HTML semantics i.e., tag names, class names and correct grouping according to the design

CSS:
--I continued with CSS i.e., setting up the universal and body selectors with their respective values
--I then proceeded to work from top to bottom :
  -starting from navigation heading, main hedaer, grid container, and finishing off with the footer
--Sizin and positioning were my main objective before moving onto stylzing the fonts
--Lastly, I create a few @media queiries in order to to adjust the background-image with all different viewport sizes


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Coming into this project, I learned that setting up a background image can be very difficult. I struggled to position the image correctly within all the viewports, which meant having fluidity when changing throughout all the viewport sizes instead of glitchy small-to-big adjustments. I used the % and vw to get somewhat of a responsive outcome. 

I also made the mistake of not using px instead of %  on my .main-header, which created an unresponsive box.
